 ## Introduction
 Functional programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on the use of functions to perform operations. 
 It is an approach to programming that emphasizes the use of pure functions and immutable data structures. 
 Some of the key concepts in functional programming include lambda expressions, map, filter, and fold. 
 Scala is a popular programming language that supports functional programming paradigms. 
 In this lesson, we will explore how these functional programming concepts are used in Scala and compare them with Racket, 
 another popular functional programming language which has been covered in our course.
 
 ## Overview of Scala
Scala is a robust, statically typed, high-level, general-purpose programming language that is compatible with both 
functional and object-oriented programming. Many of Scala's design choices are intended to address Java criticisms 
because it is designed to be concise.  
Scala offers a simple syntax for defining **anonymous functions**(lambda expressions) and also enables 
the use higher-order functions.
Scala is widely used in industry and academia for a variety of applications, including web development,
data analysis, and scientific computing. Its combination of object-oriented and functional programming features make 
it a versatile language that can be used for many different types of projects.

Currently, Scala 2 and Scala 3 are two major versions of the Scala programming language. 
The main version of Scala has been Scala 2 from its initial release in 2004. 
In 2020, Scala 3, also known as Dotty, saw its initial release. It is a significant update to the 
language that adds a number of new features and enhancements.

In this lesson, we will be using **Scala 3** to demonstrate HOPs in Scala.
