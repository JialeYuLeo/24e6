 ## Introduction
 Functional programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on the use of functions to perform operations. 
 It is an approach to programming that emphasizes the use of pure functions and immutable data structures. 
 Some of the key concepts in functional programming include lambda expressions, map, filter, and fold. 
 Scala is a popular programming language that supports functional programming paradigms. 
 In this lesson, we will explore how these functional programming concepts are used in Scala and compare them with Racket, 
 another popular functional programming language which has been covered in our course.
 
 ## Overview of Scala
Scala is a robust, statically typed, high-level, general-purpose programming language that is compatible with both 
functional and object-oriented programming. Many of Scala's design choices are intended to address Java criticisms 
because it is designed to be concise.
